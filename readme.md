**NOTE:** With the current code, changing the batch size of RoBERTa changes its performance. To get the highest possible performance, use an eval batch size of 1. This is probably connected to the tokenization call and the used padding in the batch. To make sure you are not affected by this set eval batch size to 1 (performance of ~0.80 for RoBERTa instead of ~0.61), or even easier use the sentence-bert implementation for encoding sentences, similar to [here](https://github.com/nlpsoc/Style-Embeddings/blob/78ec8cfb3d0493b7df11241897f412a52aee6f46/src/style_embed/utility/trained_similarities.py).


Thank you for your interest in STEL! This is the code going with the EMNLP 2021 main conference paper [Does It Capture STEL? A Modular, Similarity-based Linguistic Style Evaluation Framework](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.569/).

# Quickstart

You can find the raw data for STEL in Data/STEL. You will need to get permission to use the formality data from Yahoo ([L6 - Yahoo! Answers ComprehensiveQuestions and Answers version 1.0 (multi part)](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=l)) as this is also the prerequisite for receiving the [GYAFC dataset](https://github.com/raosudha89/GYAFC-corpus). Please e-mail me (a.m.wegmann@uu.nl) with the permission to receive the full data necessary to run STEL. You will need to add the files to the repository as specified in ```to_add_const.py```.

To use it, in the project folder src, call

```python
import eval_style_models

eval_style_models.eval_sim()
```

This will call all implemented style similarity models on the current version of STEL (except for deepstyle and LIWC based models).  Can take a long time. Might run into RAM problems (depending on your machine).

To only call a specific method on style:

```python
import eval_style_models
import style_similarity

eval_style_models.eval_sim(style_objects=[style_similarity.WordLengthSimilarity()])
```

Do not forget the instantiation via '()'. See some further example calls in `example_eval_style_models.py`. You will need to set LOCAL_STEL_DIM_QUAD to `/Data/STEL/dimensions/_quad_stel-dimensions_formal-815_complex-815.tsv'`.

Expected output:

```

When running on the provided sample of STEL only, the output will look different (see below). Keep in mind that this does not include the full variability of STEL though. It is using a sample, i.e., `/Data/STEL/dimensions/quad_stel-dimension_simple-100_sample.tsv` and `Data/STEL/dimensions/quad_stel-dimension_formal-100_sample.tsv`.

```



Possible models to call upon (compare to the paper):

```
UncasedBertSimilarity(), LevenshteinSimilarity(), CharacterThreeGramSimilarity(), PunctuationSimilarity(), WordLengthSimilarity(), UppercaseSimilarity(), PosTagSimilarity(), CasedBertSimilarity(), UncasedSentenceBertSimilarity(), RobertaSimilarity(), USESimilarity(), BERTCasedNextSentenceSimilarity(), BERTUncasedNextSentenceSimilarity(), DeepstyleSimilarity(), LevenshteinSimilarity(), LIWCStyleSimilarity(), LIWCSimilarity() 
```

To add your own model, implement the abstract similarity class. Either implement the ```similarity(self, sentence_1: str, sentence_2: str) -> float``` or override the ```similarities(self, sentences_1: List[str], sentences_2: List[str]) -> List[float]``` function for a more efficient implementation. Only similarities will be called. 
```python
from style_similarity import Similarity 

class MySimilarity(Similarity):
    def similarity(self, sentence_1: str, sentence_2: str) -> float:
        if len(sentence_1) == 0 and len(sentence_2) == 0:
            return self.SAME  # same style is at 1
        else:
            return self.DISTINCT # distinct style is at 0
```

To call this new method on STEL:

```python
eval_style_models.eval_sim(style_objects=[MySimilarity()])
```

# Structure

When you add all necessary (partly proprietary) data to use ALL functionalities, the folder should look something like this. Files starting with _ include proprietary data (see below). They are not included in the public release but will need to be acquired. The Datasets folder contains files that were used to generate STEL. They were not included because of size. Here, the GYAFC_Corpus also needs permission from Verizon. Everything else in the Datasets folder can be downloaded from different sources, see also ```to_add_const.py```.

# Prerequisites

## Python Libraries

### STEL light

 Code tested on python 3.8.5. If you only want to use STEL with your own models, the relevant packages with the tested versions are:

```
pandas==1.1.3
numpy==1.18.5
scikit-learn==0.23.2
nltk==3.6.2
typing==3.10.0.0
```

Tested functionality for calling eval_style_models.py only.

### STEL

If you also want to call the neural similarity methods, you will also need the following packages: 

```
transformers==3.5.1
torch==1.7.0
sentence-transformers==2.0.0
scipy==1.7.1
```

### using deepstyle

see: https://github.com/hayj/DeepStyle

``` h5py==2.10.0 
h5py==2.10.0
transformers==2.4.1
tensorflow-gpu==2.0
```

Also, in ```model.py```, you will need to add the line ```import os```.

## Proprietary data

The file ```to_add_const.py``` contains the paths and information to all files that are not part of the GitHub release but are necessary to run (part) of the code. Some files were not added because of their size and others because the data is proprietary:

For **LIWC-based similarities** the repository expects the [LIWC 2015 dictionary](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/31333/LIWC2015_LanguageManual.pdf) in ```Data/Models/_LIWC2015_Dictionary.dic```

For the **formal/informal STEL dimension**, you will need to get permission to use the formality data from Yahoo ([L6 - Yahoo! Answers ComprehensiveQuestions and Answers version 1.0 (multi part)](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=l)) as this is also the prerequisite for receiving the [GYAFC dataset](https://github.com/raosudha89/GYAFC-corpus). Please e-mail me (a.m.wegmann@uu.nl) with the permission to receive the full data necessary to run STEL and add it to ```Data/STEL/dimensions/_quad_stel-dimensions_formal-815_complex-815.tsv```.  We received a limited waiver to release a  sample of 100 STEL formal/informal tasks with this GitHub release to test the code. It still falls under the Yahoo's Terms of Use and you will need to get permission from them to use Yahoo's data in your own publications.

We propose the modular, fine-grained and content-controlled similarity-based STyle EvaLuation framework (STEL) to test the performance of any model that can compare two sentences on style. We illustrate STEL with two general dimensions of style (formal/informal and simple/complex) as well as two specific characteristics of style (contrac{'}tion and numb3r substitution). We find that BERT-based methods outperform simple versions of commonly used style measures like 3-grams, punctuation frequency and LIWC-based approaches. We invite the addition of further tasks and task instances to STEL and hope to facilitate the improvement of style-sensitive measures.",
